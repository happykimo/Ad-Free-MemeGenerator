#Description 
This is an ad-free memegenerator made by Andrew Cao and Kimo Jumamil for the 2021 TritonHacks Hackathon. We improved upon the MemeGeneratorStarter kit to create our app,
Triton Memes. Our app allows users to access random memes and create their own memes. Users are also able to save the random memes they get locally to their device gallery. Users
are also able to create their own memes and save them to the gallery. Try our app, you won't be disappointed :)
